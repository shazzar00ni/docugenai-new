## Tips for Best Results

### Organize Your Content

### Name Your Files Meaningfully

- ✅ `getting-started.md`
- ✅ `api-reference.md`
- ❌ `doc1.md`
- ❌ `untitled.md`

### Include Code Examples

Use code blocks for better formatting:

\`\`\`javascript
function hello() {
console.log("Hello, World!");
}
\`\`\`

### Add Links and Images

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
![Alt text](image-url.jpg)
```
